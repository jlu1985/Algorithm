/**

 * <p>
 * <b>Bubble sort</b>, sometimes incorrectly referred to as sinking sort, is a simple
 * sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be
 * sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are
 * in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are
 * needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name
 * from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Because it
 * only uses comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison sort.
 * Although the algorithm is simple, most of the other sorting algorithms are
 * more efficient for large lists.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Performance</b>: Bubble sort has worst-case and average complexity both
 * О(n2), where n is the number of items being sorted. There exist many sorting
 * algorithms with substantially better worst-case or average complexity of O(n
 * log n). Even other О(n2) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, tend to
 * have better performance than bubble sort. Therefore, bubble sort is not a
 * practical sorting algorithm when n is large.
